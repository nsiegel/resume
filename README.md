This is my resume generated with the nunchuks templating engine and bootstrap.
The included gulp file will also generate a pdf. Feel free to fork if you find
this at all useful.

### Build Steps
This project uses gulp
* install gulp globally `npm install -g gulp`
* install the node packages in this project `npm install`
* run `gulp build`

The gulp build process also takes an argument `--theme` that can be used to
switch between all current bootswatch themes. The paper theme is used as a
default. e.g. `gulp build --theme=journal`

### Next
* possibly turn this into a markdown only type of thing.
